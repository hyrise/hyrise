# This function helps with embedding the LLVM bitcode representation (LLVM-IR) of some source files into a
# compiled binary to make them available to the just-in-time compilation engine.
#
# Usage: embed_llvm(OUTPUT_FILE SYMBOL_NAME ${INPUT_FILES})
# The LLVM bitcode can then be embedded into some binary, by adding ${OUTPUT_FILE} to its sources
#
#
# How it works:
# 1. The file "embed_llvm/${SYMBOL_NAME}.cpp" is generated. It #include(s) all input files - one per line.
#    This is necessary to compile all source files as a single unit while ensuring that both absolute and relative
#    includes are resolved properly.
# 2. The "embed_llvm/${SYMBOL_NAME}.cpp" is compiled to a binary LLVM-IR representation (hence the -emit-llvm flag).
#    Only Clang supports this feature, so this function should only be called if CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER is set to Clang 6.0
#    or newer. The compilation result is stored in "embed_llvm/${SYMBOL_NAME}.bc".
# 3. To embed this file as a resource into a binary, an auxilary assembly file is generated. The file defines the
#    global symbols "opossum::${SYMBOL_NAME}" and "opossum::${SYMBOL_NAME}_size" (due to differences in name mangling
#    between macOS and Linux, each symbol must be exported twice).
# 4. The path to the assembly file is returned to the parent scope via the OUTPUT_FILE variable. Any binary linking this
#    file can access the embedded bitcode in the following way:
#
#    extern char opossum::${SYMBOL_NAME};
#    extern size_t opossum::${SYMBOL_NAME}_size;
#
#    std::string bitcode_string(&opossum::${SYMBOL_NAME}, opossum::${SYMBOL_NAME}_size);
