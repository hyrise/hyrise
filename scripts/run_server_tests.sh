# This test script can be used to test the Hyrise server interface with a real client. Testing only within C++ does not
# provide the full end2end-test-like experience :) This is basically just a check to see if the server starts correctly
# and can interact with clients. We cannot do this in our regular testing framework because it requires us to mock the
# actual network interface.
#
# usage: ./scripts/run_server_test.sh

# This script requires psql to be pre-installed
