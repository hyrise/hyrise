// This script measures the runtime of jobs executed. After cancelling the execution of this
// script a detailed summary of jobs ran will be printed to the console as a histogram. It provides the same
// functionality as `job_start_end.stp`.
// NOTE: the job_start probe needs some time to retrieve the job's callers. If there are many short running ones
//       it might lead to a crash of this script, since the event handling overhead is too high (it always has to
//       look on the stack). You can simply comment it out if you want. Of course, you will lose the information
//       about the job caller.
