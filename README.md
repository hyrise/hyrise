[![Build Status](https://ares.epic.hpi.uni-potsdam.de/jenkins/buildStatus/icon?job=Hyrise/zweirise/master)](https://ares.epic.hpi.uni-potsdam.de/jenkins/job/Hyrise/job/zweirise/)

# Hyrise v2 (Codename OpossumDB)

*Have a look at our [contributor guidelines](https://github.com/hyrise/zweirise/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)*

The [wiki](https://github.com/hyrise/zweirise/wiki) is a good starting point to get to know Hyrise

## Easy start
To get all dependencies of Hyrise in a docker image, run
```
docker-compose build
```

You can start the container via
```
docker-compose run --rm opossum
```
:whale:

In the container, continue with [Building and Tooling](#building-and-tooling).

## Dependencies
You can install the dependencies on your own or use the install.sh script which installs all of the following packages.
The install script was tested under macOS (brew) and Ubuntu 16.10 (apt-get).

### Dependencies that can be installed via a package manager
- autoconf
- automake
- build-essential (linux)
- boost (>= 1.61.0)
- clang (>= 3.5.0) optional if gcc is installed
- clang-format (>= 3.8) optional
- CMake (>= 3.5)
- gcc (>= 6.1) optional if clang is installed
- gcovr (>= 3.2) optional
- libtool
- llvm (optional for AddressSanitizer)
- pkg-config
- python (>= 2.7) optional
- tbb/libtbb-dev
- xcode-select --install (macOS)

### Dependencies that are integrated in our build process via git submodules
- benchmark (https://github.com/google/benchmark)
- googletest (https://github.com/google/googletest)
- protoc and gRPC (https://github.com/grpc/grpc)
- sql-parser (https://github.com/hyrise/sql-parser)

The install script builds protoc and gRPC. For manual compilation:

Compile via `CPPFLAGS="-Wno-deprecated-declarations" CFLAGS="-Wno-deprecated-declarations -Wno-implicit-function-declaration -Wno-shift-negative-value" make static --directory=third_party/grpc REQUIRE_CUSTOM_LIBRARIES_opt=true`.

## Building and Tooling

It is highly recommended to perform out-of-source builds, i.e., creating a separate directory for the build.
Advisable names for this directory would be `cmake-build-{debug,release}`, depending on the build type.
Within this directory call `cmake ..` to configure the build.
Subsequent calls to CMake, e.g., when adding files to the build will not be necessary, the generated Makefiles will take care of that.

### Compiler choice
CMake will default to your system's default compiler.
To use a different one, call like `cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ ..` in a clean build directory.

### Build
Simply call `make -j*`, where `*` denotes the number of threads to use.

Usually debug binaries are created.
To configure a build directory for a release build make sure it is empty and call CMake like `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`

### Lint
`./scripts/lint.sh` (Google's cpplint is used which needs python 2.7)

### Format
`./scripts/format.sh` (clang-format is used)

### Test
Calling `make opossumTest` from the build directory builds all available tests.
The binary can be executed with `./<YourBuildDirectory/>opossumTest`.
Note, that the tests/asan/etc need to be executed from the project root in order for table-files to be found.

### Coverage
`./scripts/coverage.sh <build dir>` will print a summary to the command line and create detailed html reports at ./coverage/index.html

*Supports only clang on MacOS and only gcc on linux*

### AddressSanitizer
`make opossumAsan` will build Hyrise with enabled AddressSanitizer options and execute all available tests.
It will fail on the first detected memory error and will print a summary.
To convert addresses to actual source code locations, make sure llvm-symbolizer is installed (included in the llvm package) and is available in `$PATH`.
To specify a custom location for the symbolizer, set `$ASAN_SYMBOLIZER_PATH` to the path of the executable.
This seems to work out of the box on macOS - If not, make sure to have llvm installed.

## Naming convention for gtest macros:

TEST(ModuleNameClassNameTest, TestName), e.g., TEST(OperatorsGetTableTest, RowCount)
same for fixtures Test_F()

If you want to test a single module, class or test you have to execute the test binary and use the `gtest_filter` option:

- Testing the storage module: `./build/test --gtest_filter="Storage*"`
- Testing the table class: `./build/test --gtest_filter="StorageTableTest*"`
- Testing the RowCount test: `./build/test --gtest_filter="StorageTableTest.RowCount"`
