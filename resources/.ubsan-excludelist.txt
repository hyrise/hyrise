# This file is an exclusion list for the undefined behavior sanitizer (UBSAN). It is not a suppression file
# (*-ignore.txt). The difference is that this file is read at compile-time while the suppression files are read at
# runtime. We cannot use a suppression because UBsan requires -fsanitize-recover to be set for these to work. That flag,
# in turn prevents the exit code from being set, and, as a result the CI from failing if UBsan finds undefined behavior.
