# This file is a blacklist for the undefined behavior sanitizer (ubsan). It is not a suppression file (*-ignore.txt).
# The difference is that this file is read at compile-time while the suppression files are read at runtime.
# We cannot use a suppression because UBsan requires -fsanitize-recover to be set for these to work. That flag, in turn
# prevents the exit code from being set, and, as a result the CI from failing if UBsan finds undefined behavior.

# The hash map seems to reinterpret memory addresses in some semi-legal (but working) way. Example:
# ska::bytell_hash_map<int, int> h; h.emplace(11, 11); std::cout << h[11] << std::endl;

# Either a false positive in LZ4 or at least something that we cannot fix ourselves, see https://github.com/lz4/lz4/issues/847
