/**
 * A rule that brings join predicates of a multi-predicate-join into an efficient order.
 * Operators like the hash join operate on the primary predicate, i.e., they hash the two columns that are compared
 * in the first predicate. Secondary predicates are evaluated using accessors, which is significantly more expensive.
 * As such, a good predicate order is even more important that it is for regular (i.e., non-join) predicates.
 * Furthermore, the hash join only supports equals predicates, so the most selective equals predicate is moved to the
 * front.
