 * A rule that tries to transform joins into semi-joins.

 * - one side of the join is not used thereafter and
 * - the join attribute on the unused side is a UCC.
 *
 * There is a dependency to the ColumnPruningRule which discovers and marks unused sides of join nodes. Thus, the
 * ColumnPruningRule must be executed in advance.
