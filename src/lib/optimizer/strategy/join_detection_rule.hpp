/**
 * This optimizer rule tries to find join conditions for cross join.
 * The rule tries to rewrite the corresponding ASTs for the following SQL statements to something that is equivalent :
 *
 * SELECT * FROM a, b WHERE a.id = b.id;
 * =>
 * SELECT * FROM a INNER JOIN b ON a.id = b.id
 *
 * ### HOW THIS WORKS ###
 *
 * The rule traverses the AST recursively untit it detects a JoinNode that has JoinMode::Cross.
 * For each Cross Join Node it will look for an appropriate join condition
 * by searching the parent nodes for PredicateNodes. Each PredicateNode is a potential candidate
 * but only those that compare two columns are interesting enough to check.
 * When such a PredicateNode is found, the rule will check whether each ColumnID comes from the left/right input.
 *
 * Note: Limited first iteration. Will only work on subtrees consisting of Joins and Predicates, so we don't
 * have to deal with ColumnID re-mappings for now. Projections, Aggregates, etc. amidst Joins and Predicates
 * should be rare anyway.
