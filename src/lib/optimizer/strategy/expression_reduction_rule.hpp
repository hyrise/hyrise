/**
 * This rule tries to simplify logical expressions, so that they can be processed faster during operator execution or
 *   be further handled by other Optimizer rules.
 *
 * Reverse Distributivity
 *   Expressions of the form `(a AND b) OR (a AND c)` are rewritten as `a AND (b OR c)`. Conjunctive chains, i.e.,
 *   `(a OR b) AND (a OR c) -> a OR (b AND c)` are currently ignored as it is has not been determined yet whether
 *   one or the other form executes faster (TODO(anybody))
 *
 * IN to Equals
 *   InExpressions with a single element in the list (`a IN (5)`) are rewritten as a normal equality scan (`a = 5`)
 *
 * Constant folding
 *   Expression involving only constants (`5 + 3 * 4`) are calculated and replaced with their result.
 *
 * LIKE to BetweenUpperExclusive
 *   `<expression> LIKE <pattern>` can be rewritten to BetweenUpperExclusive if `<pattern>` is a prefix wildcard
 *   literal.
 *   E.g., `a LIKE 'abc%'` becomes `a BetweenUpperExclusive 'abc' AND 'abd'`
 *
 * NOT LIKE to LessThan-Or-GreaterThanEquals
 *   `<expression> NOT LIKE <pattern>` can be rewritten to a LessThan-Or-GreaterThanEquals scan if `<pattern>` is a
 *   prefix wildcard literal.
 *   E.g., `a NOT LIKE 'abc%'` becomes `a < 'abc' OR a >= 'abcd'`
