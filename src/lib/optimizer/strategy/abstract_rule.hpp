   * This function applies the concrete Optimizer Rule to an LQP.
   * The default implementation
   *  (1) optimizes the root LQP
   *  (2) optimizes all (nested) subquery LQPs of the optimized root LQP, one-by-one.
   *
   *      IMPORTANT NOTES ON OPTIMIZING SUBQUERY LQPS:
   *
   *      Multiple Expressions in different nodes might reference the same LQP. Most commonly this will be the case
   *      for a ProjectionNode computing a subquery and a subsequent PredicateNode filtering based on it.
   *      We do not WANT to optimize the LQP twice (optimization takes time after all) and we CANNOT optimize it
   *      twice, since, e.g., a non-deterministic rule, could produce two different LQPs while optimizing and then the
   *      SubqueryExpression in the PredicateNode couldn't be resolved to a column anymore. There are more subtle
   *      ways LQPs might break in this scenario, and frankly, this is one of the weak links in the expression system...
   *
   *      ...long story short:
   *      !!!
   *      EACH UNIQUE SUB-LQP IS ONLY OPTIMIZED ONCE, EVEN IF IT OCCURS IN DIFFERENT NODES/EXPRESSIONS.
   *      !!!
   *
   * Rules can define their own strategy of optimizing subquery LQPs by overriding this function. See, for example, the
   * StoredTableColumnAlignmentRule.
