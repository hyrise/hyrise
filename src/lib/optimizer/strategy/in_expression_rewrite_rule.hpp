//   MAX_ELEMENTS_FOR_DISJUNCTION elements and the elements are of the same type.
// - a semi/anti join (with the list of IN values being stored in a temporary table) if the right side has more than
//   MIN_ELEMENTS_FOR_JOIN elements and the elements are of the same type. The exact value of MIN_ELEMENTS_FOR_JOIN
//   also depends on the size of the input data (see #1817). Once this becomes relevant, we might want to add a cost
//   estimator.
// Otherwise, the IN expression is untouched and will be handled by the ExpressionEvaluator.
