 * This optimizer rule replaces PredicateNodes that contain a like condition with BinaryPredicateExpressions..
 * For example, column LIKE "abc%" can be replaced by column >= "abc" AND column < "abd" to be executed in a more efficient way.
 * String comparisons are expensive and BinaryPredicateExpressions can benefit from Hyrise's encodings since these operations are executed on ValueIDs and string comparisons are avoided.
