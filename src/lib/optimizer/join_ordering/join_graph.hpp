/**
 * Represents a connected subgraph of an LQP, with the LQPNodes "above" contained in the output_relations and the
 * subplans "below" it being the vertices.
 * The JoinGraph clusters Predicates operating on the same set of vertices into JoinEdges.
 *
 * In opposition to the LQP, the `JoinGraph` has no notion of the order in which Predicates and Joins (which are really
 * just Predicates as well, as far as the `JoinGraph` is concerned) are performed. Instead, it provides facilities
 * to identify all Predicates that operate on a set of Vertices (i.e. LQP nodes) - the find_predicates() functions.
 *
 * A JoinGraph abstracts from PredicateNodes and JoinNodes and represents them as JoinEdges. It is the fundamental data
 * structure that Join Ordering algorithms operate on. See e.g. DpCcp.
