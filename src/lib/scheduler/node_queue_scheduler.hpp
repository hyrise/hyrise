/**
 *
 * SCHEDULER AND TOPOLOGY
 *
 * For setting up the NodeQueueScheduler, the server's topology is used. A topology encapsulates the
 * machine's architecture, e.g., the number of CPU threads and NUMA nodes, where a node is typically a socket or CPU
 * (usually having multiple threads/cores).
 * Each node owns a TaskQueue. Furthermore, one worker is assigned to one CPU thread. A worker running on one CPU
 * thread of a node is primarily pulling from the local TaskQueue of this node.
 *
 * A topology can also be created with Hyrise::get().topology.use_fake_numa_topology() to simulate a NUMA system with
 * multiple nodes (thus, TaskQueues) and workers and should mainly be used for testing NUMA concepts on non-NUMA
 * development machines.
 *
 *
 * WORK STEALING
 *
 * Currently, a simple work stealing is implemented. Work stealing is useful to avoid idle workers (and therefore idle
 * CPU threads) while there are still tasks in the system that need to be processed. A worker gets idle when its local
 * TaskQueue is empty. In this case, the worker is checking non-local TaskQueues of other NUMA nodes for tasks. The
 * worker pulls a task from a remote TaskQueue and checks if this task is stealable. If not, the task is pushed to the
 * TaskQueue again.
 * In case no tasks can be processed, the worker thread is put to sleep and waits on the semaphore of its node-local
 * TaskQueue.
 *
 * Note: currently, TaskQueues are not explicitly allocated on a NUMA node. This means most workers will frequently
 * access distant TaskQueues, which is ~1.6 times slower than accessing a local node [1].
