 *
 *  1. All tasks are initialized in TaskState::Created.
 *  2. A task changes to TaskState::Scheduled once task->schedule() has been called.
 *  3. Subsequent state transitions depend on the type of scheduler:
 *   a) The NodeQueueScheduler has the concept of workers:
 *      - For a given set of scheduled tasks, it pushes only those tasks to a worker queue that are ready for
 *        execution. When pushed to a worker queue, tasks get marked as enqueued and switch to TaskState::Enqueued.
 *      - Once a worker pulls a task from a queue, it should no longer be executed by anyone else. Consequently, the
 *        worker changes the task's state to TaskState::AssignedToWorker.
 *      - There may also be tasks that never see a worker queue before execution: A TableScan task, for example, issues
 *        several child tasks. Some of them will be executed directly by the worker that executes the TableScan. Thus,
 *        tasks can directly switch from TaskState::Scheduled to TaskState::AssignedToWorker.
 *   b) The ImmediateExecutionScheduler does not have a concept of workers and work queues. Instead, it executes tasks
 *      immediately after task->schedule() has been called. Consequently, tasks never enter TaskState::Enqueued and
 *      TaskState::AssignedToWorker.
 *  4. A task switches to TaskState::Started when execute() is called.
 *  5. After finishing its work, execute() transitions the task to TaskState::Done.
 *
 * Note that the state machine's _try_transition_to function ensures that tasks can be marked as scheduled / enqueued /
 * assigned once only, respectively.
