/**
 * StorageRegion manages read and write access of pages to a block storage device. StorageRegion can either use a block
 * device directly by assigning equal-sized regions to each page size type or use a directory with one file for each
 * page size type. Files are opened using direct IO to bypass the OS page cache. On Linux, we use the O_DIRECT when
 * opening the file. On macOS, we use the F_NOCACHE flag after opening the file. O_DIRECT requires read and write
 * buffers to be aligned to the page boundary (e.g. 4KB). Destructing the StorageRegion closes all open file descriptors
 * and deletes all files in the directory. Block devices are not cleared.
 * 
 * Writing and reading concurrently to different pages is thread-safe. Accessing the same page should be guarded with
 * concurrency primitives accordingly. We usually use the exclusive latching defined by the Frame class. Currently, we
 * only support synchronous IO, which means that the calling thread is blocked until the IO operation has finished.
 * Employing aio, libaio or io_uring is considered future work, but may lead to significant performance improvements.
