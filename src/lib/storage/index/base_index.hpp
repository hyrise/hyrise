/**
 * BaseIndex is the abstract super class for all index types, e.g. GroupKeyIndex, CompositeGroupKeyIndex,
 * ARTIndex etc.
 * It is assumed that all index types support range queries and that they are composite indexes.
 * I.e. the index is sorted based on the column order. To check whether a key is less than another
 * key, the comparison is performed for the first column. If and only if they are equal, a check is
 * executed for the part of the next column. If needed, this step is repeated for all column
 * parts of both keys.
 * Since all indexes have to support range queries, we chose to use iterators as means to get all
 * values that are requested from an index.
 * Further, this allows to use many stl functions like std::transform, std::for_each, std::find ...
 * In addition to that, we save space and time as it is not needed to copy values (compared to returning vectors of
 * values).
 * Instead, each index is able to return an index for the lower and one for the upper bound of the requested value(s).
 * As each index has a different way of iterating over its data structures, it has to implement its iterator as well.
 * We might use the impl-pattern similar to the TableScan, but this will be in a future commit.
 *
 * Find more information about this in our wiki: https://github.com/hyrise/hyrise/wiki/BaseIndex and
 *                                               https://github.com/hyrise/hyrise/wiki/Indexes
