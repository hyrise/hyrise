/* This class can be used as a drop-in specialization for the LQPTranslator.
 * The JitAwareLQPTranslator will try to translate multiple AbstractLQPNodes into a single JitOperatorWrapper, whenever
 * that is possible and seems beneficial. Otherwise, it will fall back to the LQPTranslator.
 *
 * It works in two steps:
 * 1) Determine if we can/should add a JitOperatorWrapper node here and which nodes we can replace:
 *    Starting from the current node, we perform a breadth-first search through the query tree.
 *    For each node we will determine whether it is jittable (based on the node's type and parameters).
 *    We will follow each branch of the tree until we hit a non-jittable node. Since StoredTableNodes are not jittable,
 *    this is guaranteed to happen for all branches.
 *    All non-jittable nodes encountered this way are stored in a set.
 *    Once the BFS terminates, we only continue if the number of jittable nodes is greater than two and the
 *    set of non-jittable nodes we encountered only contains a single node. This is then used as the input
 *    node to the chain of jit operators.
 * 2) Once we know which nodes we want to jit, we can start building out JitOperatorWrapper:
 *    We start by adding a JitReadTuples node. This node is passed to all translation functions during the construction
 *    of further operators. If any jit operator depends on a column or literal value, this value is registered with the
 *    JitReadTuples operator. The operator returns a JitTupleEntry that serves as a placeholder in the requesting
 *    operator. The JitReadTuples operator will make sure that the actual value is then accessible through the
 *    JitTupleEntry at runtime.
 *    The output columns are determined by the top-most ProjectionNode. If there is no ProjectionNode, all columns from
 *    the input node are considered as outputs.
 *    In case we find any PredicateNode or UnionNode during our traversal, we need to create a JitFilter operator.
 *    Whenever a non-primitive value (such as a predicate conditions, LQPExpression of LQPColumnReferences - which
 *    can in turn reference a LQPExpression in a ProjectionNode) is encountered, it is converted to an JitExpression
 *    by a helper method first. We then add a JitCompute operator to our chain and use its result value instead of the
 *    original non-primitive value.
