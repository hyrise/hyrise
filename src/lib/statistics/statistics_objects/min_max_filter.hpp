/**
 * Filters are data structures that are primarily used for probabilistic membership queries. In Hyrise, they are
 * typically created on a single segment. They can then be used to check whether a certain value exists in the segment.
 * While histograms also support does_not_contain, their main purpose is not to answer membership queries, but to
 * provide statistics estimations.
 *
 * The MinMaxFilter is a filter that stores the minimum and maximum value for the covered values.
 *
 * MinMaxFilters could be expressed as a single-bin histogram. This is not done for two reasons: First, we like to keep
 * filters and histograms separate, as they serve different purposes. Having histograms both on a per-segment basis
 * (for membership queries) and on a per-column basis (for cardinality estimations) could lead to confusion. Second,
 * building such a histogram would be more expensive than build a MinMaxFilter, as we would have to look at each value
 * instead of only looking at the distinct values (which is significantly cheaper for dictionary encoding).
