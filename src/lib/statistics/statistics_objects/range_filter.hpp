/**
 * Filters are data structures that are primarily used for probabilistic membership queries. In Hyrise, they are
 * typically created on a single segment. They can then be used to check whether a certain value exists in the segment.
 * While histograms also support does_not_contain, their main purpose is not to answer membership queries, but to
 * provide statistics estimations.
 *
 * The RangeFilter stores a certain number of value ranges. Each range represents a spread of values that is contained
 * within the bounds. Ranges are chosen so that the cumulative size of all gaps is maximal.
 * Example: [2, 3, 5, 8, 9, 11] with max_ranges_count=3 will be represented as [2, 3] [5, 5] [8, 11].
 * RangeFilters are typically created for a single segment and can be used to check whether a certain value exists in
 * the segment.
 *
 * RangeFilters could be expressed as a type of histogram. This is not done for two reasons: First, we like to keep
 * filters and histograms separate, as they serve different purposes. Having histograms both on a per-segment basis
 * (for membership queries) and on a per-column basis (for cardinality estimations) could lead to confusion. Second,
 * building such a histogram would be more expensive than build a RangeFilter, as we would have to look at each value
 * instead of only looking at the distinct values (which is significantly cheaper for dictionary encoding).
