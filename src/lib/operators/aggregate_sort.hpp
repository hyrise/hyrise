/*
 * Operator to aggregate columns by certain functions such as min, max, sum, average, and count with a sort-based approach.
 * The output is a table with value segments.
 *
 * As with most operators we do not guarantee a stable operation with regards to positions - i.e. your sorting order.
 * This might sound surprising, since this is the sort-based aggregate, so here the reasoning:
 * The output table of this operator contains only the columns we have grouped by, and the aggregates.
 * The aggregate columns contain new values, so there is nothing they could be stable to.
 * The input table is sorted after the group by columns, using the Sort operator.
 * Thus we cannot expect the group by columns to keep their original order (unless they were sorted).
 *
 * However, you can expect the group by columns to be sorted, currently from the last to the first one.
 *
 * The following wiki entry contains some information about the aggregate operator:
 * https://github.com/hyrise/hyrise/wiki/Operators_Aggregate .
 * While most of this page refers to the hash-based aggregate, it also explains common features like aggregate traits.
 *
 * Some notes regarding future optimization:
 * Currently, we always sort the input table by the group by columns.
 * In some cases this might be unnecessary, as the table could already be sorted.
 * There is an issue that discusses how such information as sortedness should be propagated:
 *  https://github.com/hyrise/hyrise/issues/1519
 * As soon as this issue is decided, the sort aggregate operator should be adapted to benefit from sortedness.
 *  If the issue comes to the conclusion that it is the optimizer's responsibility to be aware of sortedness,
 *  this operator might be refactored to expect sorted input and to not sort at all;
 *  and let the optimizer add the required sort operators to the LQP.
 *
 *  To be precise: We do NOT need the input to be sorted.
 *  What we actually need is that all rows belonging to the same group are consecutive,
 *  and sorting is merely a technique to achieve consecutiveness.
 *   There is one minor thing we lose if the input is consecutive but not sorted: the output will not be sorted either.
 *   However, the output of an aggregate is usually much smaller than the input, so it is still more efficient
 *   to aggregate on the consecutive input and then sort the output, than sorting the input and then aggregating it.
