/* The JitRuntimePointer class hierarchy represents concrete memory locations of LLVM bitcode pointer values.
 * A primer on LLVM pointer values:
 * LLVM provides a number of instructions for performing operations on pointer values.
 * LLVM, however, does not have any concept of concrete, materialized pointer values. Pointers represent the memory
 * location of a value in an abstract way, but LLVM has no way of knowing where a value will be located in memory at
 * compile-time. Nonetheless, several operations can be performed on these abstract pointer values.
 * - Bitcast instructions change the data type of a pointer, but does not change the value of a pointer.
 * - Load instructions load a piece of memory into a variable, similar to dereferencing pointers in C++.
 * - GetElementPtr instructions apply an offset to a pointer value (e.g., to access a member field in a
 *   structure type)
 * These instructions can be combined to navigate arbitrarily nested and linked data structures.
 * We represent a set of LLVM pointer instructions that access some nested value by a chain of JitRuntimePointer
 * subclasses.
 * Each type of LLVM instruction is represented by a specific JitRuntimePointer subclass that can simulate the
 * equivalent operation on a "real" pointer.
 * All of these chains end with a JitConstantRuntimePointer that contains a constant pointer value. This value is not
 * fetched from the LLVM bitcode, but must be supplied by the caller. It serves as the source for runtime information.
 * Starting from this value, that chain of JitRuntimePointer instances can simulate the pointer operations in the LLVM
 * bitcode.
 * The JitRuntimePointer class hierarchy provides several helper functions to navigate these nested memory operations
 * (e.g., to get the total offset of consecutive GetElementPtr instructions).
 * The JitRuntimePointer base class represents pointer values that cannot be resolved to a physical address and are
 * thus invalid.
 *
 * Example:
 * struct TreeNode {
 *   int32_t value;
 *   TreeNode* left_child;
 *   TreeNode* right_child;
 * }
 *
 * Accessing the value of some internal node like so ...
 *
 * root->left_child->right_child->value;
 *
 * ... roughly translates to the following pointer instructions in LLVM:
 * %1 = getelementptr %root, 4  // add an offset to the root pointer to locate the "left_child" field within the object
 * %2 = load %1                 // dereference this pointer to get a pointer to the actual left_child
 * %3 = getelementptr %2, 12    // add an offset to the left_child pointer to locate the "right_child" field
 * %4 = load %3                 // dereference this pointer to get a pointer to the actual right_child
 * %5 = bitcast %4 to int32_t*  // no need to apply an offset, since the offset to the value is 0,
 *                              // but the pointer type needs to change
 * %6 = load %5                 // dereference the casted pointer to load the actual value
 *
 * If the memory location of the root pointer is known, the physical address of the desired value can be computed by the
 * JitRuntimePointer class hierarchy.
