/**
 * Welcome to the benchmark playground. Here, you can quickly compare two
 * approaches in a minimal setup. Of course you can also use it to just benchmark
 * one single thing.
 *
 * In this example, a minimal TableScan-like operation is used to evaluate the
 * performance impact of pre-allocating the result vector (PosList in hyrise).
 *
 * A few tips:
 * * The optimizer is not your friend. If you do a bunch of calculations and
 *   don't actually use the result, it will optimize your code out and you will
 *   benchmark only noise.
 * * benchmark::DoNotOptimize(<expression>); marks <expression> as "globally
 *   aliased", meaning that the compiler has to assume that any operation that
 *   *could* access this memory location will do so.
 *   However, despite the name, this will not prevent the compiler from
 *   optimizing this expression itself!
 * * benchmark::ClobberMemory(); can be used to force calculations to be written
 *   to memory. It acts as a memory barrier. In combination with DoNotOptimize(e),
 *   this function effectively declares that it could touch any part of memory,
 *   in particular globally aliased memory.
 * * More information on that: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40122141/
