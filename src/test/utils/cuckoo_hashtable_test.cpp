This test is rather useless as it is, because it does not produce a collision that is valid for all used hash functions.
For example, 4 and 3617331 collide for the first function, but not for the second. We have not faced a situation yet,
in which all internal hash function collide for the same values.
However, it would definitely make sense to add a test with appropriate values, as soon as we find them.
